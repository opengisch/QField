    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The aim of this paper is to highlight the main benefits of using the QField app. An App that can be installed on
      an Android device for all archaeologists working in the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main feature of this new application will allow the archaeologist to upload to his/her smartphone or tablet
      the .qgs project of the excavation based on the general information concerning the site that is already available
      to you. At this point, it is possible to implement the collection of data directly on site, maintaining constant
      updates to your system, thus allowing you to review the project throughout the excavation process.
    </p>
    <h4>
      The “pocket-GIS” with QField is finally a reality!
    </h4>
    <p>
      Working with QField in the field allows us to significantly reduce registration and computerisation time of
      inputting data into the database system, eliminating the digiti- sation of field registers and all related
      paperwork. The advantage of entrusting all of the information to the main GIS platform of the project (master),
      which is stored inside the PC, means this leaves only the task of checking the collected data, along with the
      bonus of in-depth topographical and geospatial analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this article, we will show a practical example of integrated use of QGIS and QField, which relates to an open
      area excavation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intervention methodology proposed in this article was constructed by the per- sonal experience of the authors;
      this specifically refers to open area excavation works in commercial archaeology projects.
    </p>

    <h3>Main features of QField</h3>
    <p>
      QField is an Android app that can be downloaded from Google Play. This application, although it presents itself
      with a very simple interface, is rich in functions such as:
    </p>
    <p>
      –Tools for digitalisation in the field;<br>
      – Geometry and attribute editing;<br>
      – GPS;<br>
      – Possibility to upload custom base maps;<br>
      – Integration of smartphone/tablet’s camera;<br>
      – Many other functions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      QField can be considered a “mobile” extension for QGIS. In fact, it allows us to view and manage a GIS project
      created with QGIS on an Android smartphone or tablet. Permitting the user to keep all set themes, labels and
      styles that are in the original project (Figure 1).
    </p>

    <h5><i>Figure 1 - An example of the same Survey GIS platform project in QGIS (below) and in QField (above). Image by
        Giuseppe Guarino 2019.</i></h5>

    <p>
      Furthermore, similar to QGIS, we can query each layer within QField by obtaining the respective information
      contained in its attribute table (however, there are also other GIS applications for mobile such as ArcGis, LiPAD,
      Bentley Map Mobile, GVSig Mobile, Geopaparazzi and others).

      In order to work with a QGIS project within QField, the first step is to configure the properties of that project
      created in QGIS as “save relative paths”.

      You will need to create a folder “folder_name” on your desktop and save in this path the .qgs file that you want
      to transfer to the smartphone or tablet; similarly, in the same folder, you have to enter all the data (vectors,
      raster and database) that make up this .QGIS project.

      These data can also be divided into further subfolders.

      Finally, you need to copy the entire folder ‘folder_name’ to the tablet, following two possible paths:

      In the internal memory: Android > data > ch.opengis.QField > files > share;
      In the external SD: Android > data > ch.opengis.QField > files.

    </p>
    <h3>Working with QField in an Archaeological Survey and Archaeological Risk Assessment Projects</h3>
    <p>
      Until recently, paper maps were the only way of recording archaeological features and the fields’ visibility in an
      archaeological survey work. Such data were digitised into a CAD or GIS software creating the individual site
      sheets separately on a simple digital document afterwards.

      Today, QField, thanks to its compatibility with QGIS, allows you to skip the transition from paper to digital or
      from different software, reducing time and costs.

      The archaeological survey (for a comprehensive account of methods of the Archaeological survey, see Cambi,
      Terrenato 1994, pp. 117–143, and Renfrew, Bahn 2016 [1,2]) must be preceded by the construction of a GIS platform
      that takes into consideration both the data acquired during the field survey phase and the bibliographic ones. For
      this reason, it will be necessary to work on two tables: one is spatial, which is useful in the field, and the
      other is alphanumeric. Both will be joined in a single spatial table, useful for consultation on the GIS desktop.
      This process is possible through the use of a relational geo-database such as SpatiaLite and PostGIS or,
      alternatively, through the creation of a join between the tables and the geometries.

      However, the big advantage of using a geo-database is the ability to create queries capable of merging information
      from two or more tables into a single table (view) (for more in-depth information on the use of GIS and
      Geodatabases in archaeology, see Fronza, Nardini, Valenti 2009 [3]).

      This process further speeds up field work by minimising the data to be stored during archaeological survey.

      The data collected in the field during the survey will be recorded and digitised through three different layers
      (point, line and polygon). The attribute tables connected to the three layers record the following information:
      Project Name (String), Municipality (String), Location (String), Feature Number (Integer), Place Name (String),
      Location (String), Date (Date), Site Definition (String), Visibility (String) and Photos (String).

      The attribute values, “Project name” and “Feature Number”, between the two tables must be Unique Constraint in
      order to identify only one unique “Project name” and only one “Feature Number”.

      The GIS platform must also have base maps such as Google Satellite, Open Street Map, Orthophotos and so on. In
      this case, we used the following maps: Carta Tecnica Regionale (1:10.000), Open Street Map e Google Satellite. To
      make these maps lighter, we created first overviews (pyramids) in QGIS.

      The positioning of the archaeological features identified can be recorded through the GPS internal device.
      However, for a greater accuracy, QField can be connected to a GNSS antenna.

      In archaeological consultancy and archaeological risk assessment jobs, it is recommended to upload into the GIS
      project an infrastructure layer containing the infrastructure’s geometric information, measurements and others,
      besides a buffer of itself.

      After setting the basics of our project on QGIS, we need to export the project through the use of the QField Sync
      plugin within QField. Alternatively, we can carry this out by simply copying the folder containing the project
      file with the * .QGIS extension, the database and the rasters (or the geopackage containing our rasters: IGM,
      Basemap and so on) into our smartphone or tablet.

      By default, QField creates a folder where you can save projects (Android/data/ ch.opengis.QField/files), but it is
      always better to store them on an external SSD, since if you were to uninstall QField from your device, all the
      folders and files contained in them will be removed running the risk of deleting the data.

      After we set up the bases of the GIS project in QGIS, we need to export it into QField through a suitable plug-in
      called QField-Sync.

      However, we can perform that task even by simply transferring (copy and paste) the QGIS project and the related
      dataset to our Android device. The QGIS project must be saved as .QGIS.
