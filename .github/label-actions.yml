        This has been accepted as an enhancement request. Good job :+1:
        Enhancement requests are very valuable to make QField better. They sometimes attract others and just happen magically. More often however they need someone to jump in and [make them come true][get in touch](https://www.opengis.ch/custom-development).

        Thanks for reporting this bug. Bugs are often fixed on a voluntary basis (see [sustainability initiative](https://www.opengis.ch/qgis-sustainability-initiative/)). This still often takes time and we need to prioritize bugs, so some may slip through the cracks. If you need this bug to be fixed in a more timely manner, [get in touch](https://www.opengis.ch/custom-development).
