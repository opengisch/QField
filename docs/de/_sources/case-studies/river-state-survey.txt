River State Survey Using QField
===============================

Goal
----

In order to assess the structural and morphological state of their water
courses, the community of Milvignes needed to survey all the rivers crossing
their territory.

Project
-------

To facilitate the technician’s field work (usually done with a map, a  notebook
and a camera), a QField project was created and made available on a Tablet.
Cadastral and river layers were used as basemap.

The structure of the input tables was designed along with the technician to
assure that it would fit their field requirements. The idea was to have two
tables:

Sector table
  To draw sectors alongside the rivers and add information about their  state
  and structure. If necessary, pre-defined structural work on the sector
  elements (wall, bridge, bottom of the canal) could also be documented. 

Point table
  To take punctual photography of the water courses and of its
  elements and where necessary add remarks.

Result
------

In less than 3 days, the techinician surveyed successfully all the 10’894
kilometers of water courses. Back at the office, it took only 2 hours to treat
the data and get the final result.

- Facilitated the field survey 
- Accelerated the data treatment
