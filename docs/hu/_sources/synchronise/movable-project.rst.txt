To manually synchronise your QGIS project, you will need a portable version of your .qgs file. Portable
means that all paths are relative and datasets are reachable from the device.

Check that :menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Save paths`
is set to "Relative" and that all required data files are in the same folder like the .qgs file or  in a subfolder.

For increased productivity, we suggest having a look at :ref:`qfieldcloud` and :ref:`qfieldsync`
