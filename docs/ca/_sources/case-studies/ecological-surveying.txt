Improving Efficiencies in Ecological Surveying using QField
===========================================================

By Ryan Bell, GIS Consultant, Delta-Simons Environmental Consultancy

Goal
----

To conduct ecological surveying more efficiently than has been previously achieved through
traditional non-digital techniques, using QField as a medium for standardised and flexible
field data collection.

Project Requirements
--------------------

To facilitate effective field work, regular consultation with the Ecology team is required
to ensure that QField projects are prepared appropriately. Firstly, basemaps comprising
aerial imagery and proposed development plans are prepared by georeferencing  and constructing
pyramids in QGIS. Point, line and polygon vector layers are then created to support digitisation
and associated data collection. Using a range of widgets, attribute fields are customised to
meet the requirements of the Ecology team. These include:

Style
  drop-down list of selectable styles tailored for conducting ecological surveys

Scale
  drop-down list of selectable scales for point and line feature

Info
  space for inserting a feature description
  
Image
  location for images to be captured and stored 

Geometry
  contains self-populated geometry values, e.g. area, perimeter, length

Timestamp
  records the time and date that a feature was created/last modified

Result
------

Delta-Simons are saving approximately 40% of the time previously consumed by traditional ecological
field data collection. QField has significantly improved the ecological surveying workflow by:

- Removing the need to recreate GIS outputs from physical drawings
- Reducing the overall amendments required for GIS outputs
- Improving communication channels (see Figure 1.)
- Improving the accuracy and quality of data
