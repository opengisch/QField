Portable Project
================

You will need a portable version of your QGIS project file (.qgs). Portable
means that all paths are relative and datasets are reachable from the device.

Check that :menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Save paths` 
is set to "Relative" and that all required data files are in the same folder like the .qgs file or a subfolder of it.

For increased productivity, we suggest having a look at the `QFieldSync plugin <https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/qfieldsync>`_.
