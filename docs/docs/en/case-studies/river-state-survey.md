title: River State Survey Using QField
---

Goal
====

In order to assess the structural and morphological state of their water
courses, the community of Milvignes needed to survey all the rivers
crossing their territory.

Project
=======

To facilitate the technician's field work (usually done with a map, a
notebook and a camera), a QField project was created and made available
on a Tablet. Cadastral and river layers were used as basemap.

The structure of the input tables was designed along with the technician
to assure that it would fit their field requirements. The idea was to
have two tables:

Sector table

:   To draw sectors alongside the rivers and add information about their
    state and structure. If necessary, pre-defined structural work on
    the sector elements (wall, bridge, bottom of the canal) could also
    be documented.

Point table

:   To take punctual photography of the water courses and of its
    elements and where necessary add remarks.

Result
======

In less than 3 days, the technician surveyed successfully all the 10'894
meters of water courses. Back at the office, it took only 2 hours to
treat the data and get the final result.

-   Facilitated the field survey
-   Accelerated the data treatment
