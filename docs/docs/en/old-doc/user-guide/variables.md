title: Global variables
---

Variables are used in QField and QGIS to dynamically set values based on
the current project file, the layer or the system. They can be used for
styling, setting default values for fields and much more.

To configure a device-specific variable, open the settings and click the
\"Global Variables\" tab.

On the variable page, you can see predefined variables. To add new
variables, click on the empty cell at the bottom and write the content.
