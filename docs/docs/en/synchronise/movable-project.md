TODO check and complete.

To manually synchronise your QGIS project, you will need a portable
version of your .qgs file. Portable means that all paths are relative
and datasets are reachable from the device.

Check that
`Project --> Project Properties --> General --> Save paths`{.interpreted-text
role="menuselection"} is set to \"Relative\" and that all required data
files are in the same folder like the .qgs file or in a subfolder.

For increased productivity, we suggest having a look at
`qfieldcloud`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and
`qfieldsync`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}
