QField is able to load a base map from a web service.

In QGIS with the plugin QFieldSync, set the base map to the \"Project
Configuration\"

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
![sync\_basemap](../assets/images/qfield-sync_basemap.png)
:::

Then make the package of the project to load it on your device.

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
![sync\_package1](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package1.png)
:::

::: {.container .clearer .text-center}
![sync\_package2](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package2.png)
