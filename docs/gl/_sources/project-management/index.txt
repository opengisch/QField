QField Project Management
#########################

QField does not have a built-in project management. You need to set up and configure your project first inside QGIS and then copy the project file (.qgs) and any additional files to your device and open it with QField.

Coordinate Reference Systems
============================

QField uses the Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information found in the project file.

* Project CRS
* On the fly reprojection (OTF) is used for visualization
* Layer CRS
