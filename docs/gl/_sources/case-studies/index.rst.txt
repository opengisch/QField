Case Studies
############
The QField project is always looking for people to publish QField case studies (user stories) on the QField website.
Therefore we kindly ask institutions, universities, authorities, and companies to write down their experience in using
QField to solve their problems in a certain project or their every day live.
Please contact_ us, if you want to send us your story, we'd be delighted to publish it.
