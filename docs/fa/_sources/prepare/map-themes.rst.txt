Configure Map Themes
====================

The beautiful thing about GIS is that maps are dynamic. Layers can individually
be shown and hidden and information can be presented more or less prominently
based on the task at hand.

This is what *Map Themes* (before QGIS 3.0 known as *Visibility Presets*) are
for.

Creating a Map Theme
--------------------

Creating a Map Theme in QGIS is a very simple task.

1. Style the map and layers to your requirements
2. Save it as a named Map Theme
3. Load the project on your device and change the active Map Theme


Change the active Map Theme
===========================

Switching Map Themes is possible from the Dashboard.

Use the *Map Themes* combobox to chose the active theme.
