Identify features
=================
Tap on a feature on the map to identify it. If several features are located on the point you tapped (either because there are multiple features really close one to another, or because several layers are overlapping), they will all be listed in the menu that opens on the right of the screen.

     :alt: identify_features
     

Tap on one of the listed feature to access its attributes. 

1. Tap the **arrows** to scroll through all the identified features.
2. Tap the **centre button** to center the map on the selected feature.
3. Tap  the **edit button** to edit the attributes of the selected feature.
4. Scroll through the **sub-menus** to access all the attributes.
 
Exceptions to identified layers
-------------------------------

Often it is not required to be able to query every layer. Some layers are only present as basemap and their attributes are not of interest.

You can manage this layerlist in QGIS desktop in :menuselection:`Project --> Project Properties --> Identify Layers` and uncheck the base layers.

Measure tool
============
Open the **Main menu** --> tap the settings button --> Measure Tool
